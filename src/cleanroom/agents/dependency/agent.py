"""Dependency Analyzer Agent.

Produces a NESTED dependency graph, purely deterministically (no LLM unless the optional
semantic pass is enabled):

  OUTER (feature level): a DAG over features plus a build order, detected from explicit
  cross-references in functional-requirement text (e.g. "see section 2.2"). Only FEATURES
  THAT HAVE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS are nodes.

  INNER (FR level): within each feature, a DAG over its FUNCTIONAL requirements, detected
  the same way (an FR whose text references another requirement in the same feature). Each
  feature carries its own `fr_order`, `fr_edges`, and `fr_cycles`.

The pipeline is FR-only: every requirement reaching this agent is a functional requirement.

Not every cross-reference is a dependency. A pointer like "more information is found in
section 2.5" tells the reader where to look; it is NOT a build prerequisite. Such
informational references are filtered out (see INFORMATIONAL_CUES) so they don't create
spurious edges — and, in turn, spurious cycles. This filtering is applied to BOTH the
regex path and the text handed to the optional semantic LLM pass, so the two stay consistent.

Edge direction convention (easy to get backwards):
    edge.source DEPENDS ON edge.target  =>  edge.target must be built BEFORE edge.source.
