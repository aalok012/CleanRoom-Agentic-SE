"""The JavaScript language target — Node.js + Express + SQLite, mirroring the Python FastAPI stack.

The Code Agent emits one self-contained module per functional requirement, each exporting a PURE
function (stdlib-only, no side effects at import) named exactly as the contract. A MECHANICAL
packager assembles them into a runnable Express app backed by a SQLite key/value store. Tests are
Jest modules; the certification oracle runs the spec-derived cases *in-process* via Node (the JS
analog of the Python executable oracle) — it loads the pure function file and calls it directly, so
no `npm install` is needed for pass@k.

v1 scope: like the Java target, proved features are NOT shipped as Dafny-core adapters (the proof
tier still runs for the verification metric); every feature goes through codegen + cert.
